            <h2>Become a Successful Entrepreneur</h2>
            <p>Becoming a successful entrepreneur doesn’t just happen overnight. But I’ll find the following
                characteristics are typical in the majority of businessmen and women that have navigated their way to
                the top.All entrepreneurs inevitably make mistakes along the path to success. But what matters most is
                that I own my failures and take full responsibility for the knock-backs and move forward quickly.</p>

            <h2>Stay Hungry and Ambitious</h2>
            <p id="padding-para">Running a successful business is not an ego trip for successful entrepreneurs. It’s
                their desire to grow
                and provide a better product or service for their customers that keeps them hungry and ambitious. The
                moment that an entrepreneur stops wanting to learn new things is the moment that complacency sets in,
                allowing others to overtake you and leave you behind.</p>

                    When I started my journey, I had no previous idea of the entrepreneurship.5 years ago everything
                    started, and allow me to say - it has been a hell of an experience so far.I enjoyed the way I was
                    learning and developing capacities. </p>

                <h3 class="orange-color">| 2021-2022 |</h3>
                <p>Today, I proudly say that I entirely dedicated myself to that organisation.I am amazed about
                    entrepreneurship - it challenges me. It drives
                    me to do more and better - yet, there is always space to do more and better.</p>
